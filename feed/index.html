								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>RUPT:<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Rapid, Unpredictable, Paradoxical, Tangled</h2>
<p>Tired of hearing the term “VUCA” at work?</p>
<p><em>Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity:</em> You may be sick of the concepts VUCA represents — or simply tired of the often-overused acronym itself.</p>
<p>In recent years, many organizations have started liberally using the term as a way to articulate or find a metaphor for describing the changing world in which we live, work, lead, and play. But this is often done without digging into its meaning.</p>
<p>For several years, we&#8217;ve been approached by clients not only to design and deliver programs that help their managers lead through the turbulence that characterizes the modern world, but also to <em>specifically to avoid using the term VUCA.</em></p>
<p>We think this is partly because of its U.S. military origins, and partly because VUCA seems to capture neither what they&#8217;re experiencing, nor how to lead through it.</p>
<h2>Our Alternative Acronym for VUCA: RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h2>
<p>In response, we tapped our own knowledge and research at CCL about leading in complexity, and developed an acronym that more readily connects the experience of disruption with the leadership necessary to navigate it. <strong>We suggest <em>RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </em>as an alternative to VUCA.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a word in its own right, but not typically used alone. As an acronym, its stands for <strong>Rapid, Unpredictable, Paradoxical, and Tangled.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid:</strong> The changes we experience come at us quickly. They overlap with each other like waves emerging from different sources crashing in mid-ocean.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpredictable:</strong> We can analyze, strategize, and predict the future, but then something totally unexpected emerges (rapidly), challenging our assumptions and causing us to reframe our thinking.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paradoxical:</strong> As leaders, we&#8217;re so easily lured into believing complex challenges are problems with one right solution, rather than seeing them as polarities that must be leveraged if our teams and organizations are to be effective in both the short and long term. For example, we must innovate for the long term, yet we have current businesses that must be managed both in the short and long term. We might be tempted to choose one or the other, but even for the short term, we really need to do both.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tangled:</strong> Everything is connected to everything else. We hear terms that imply the connectedness of everything, like &#8220;the global village.&#8221; We live in multiple ecosystems, all of them having internal and external connections that we might overlook in our attempts to strategize and implement strategy effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Explained</h2>
<p><em>Rumpere</em>, in Latin, means “to break, to burst.” With the prefix <em>ab-</em>, or “off,” the Latin forms <em>abrumpere</em>, “to break off.” And <em>abruptus</em> is the origin of the English word <em>abrupt</em>.</p>
<p>Rupture is an English word that still retains the literal meaning of “bursting,” as do dis<em>rupt</em> and inter<em>rupt</em>: all are derived from the same <em>rumpere</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>DisRUPTion happens when RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is in play and leadership fumbles. </strong></em></p>
<p>Here are 3 possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an organization isn&#8217;t agile, or it over-relies on prediction, to the detriment of adapting.</li>
<li>When the paradoxical tension between rapid adaptation and stable prediction (to name just one of many paradoxical tensions) freezes leadership.</li>
<li>When rapid, unpredictable paradoxes are embedded in “tangled” causes and effect chaotic systems, triggering reactions that are more subjective than linear or logical.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these these challenging situations sound all too familiar, the good news is that RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> also offers competencies for navigating complex challenges:</p>

<h2>3 Specific Approaches for Using RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> to Navigate Turbulence</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333;">The mindset, skillset, and toolset emerging from this work enables leaders to move from RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, as it is currently experienced, to new ways of thinking, reframing, and navigating the turbulence they are experiencing. H</span>ere are 3 specific approaches.</p>
<h3>1. Nurturing and Practicing Learning Agility.</h3>
<p>Since the turbulence of RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is relentless and nothing can be taken for granted, developing <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/how-to-enjoy-a-long-career/">learning agility is essential throughout your career</a>.</p>
<p>CCL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ccl.org/people/george-hallenbeck/">George Hallenbeck</a> defines learning agility as: “the ability and willingness to learn from experience and subsequently apply that learning to perform successfully under new and challenging conditions.”</p>
<p>Hallenbeck goes on to say: “Learning agility is an essential skill for leaders during times of change when both problems and their solutions lack clarity.” In short, <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/white-papers/great-leaders-are-great-learners-how-to-develop-learning-agile-high-potentials/">great leaders are great learners</a>.</p>
<p>In a RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> environment, we don’t have the luxury of relying entirely on sending our leaders through leadership development experiences. Instead, we need to see <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/influence-personal-life-leadership/">real-life challenges</a> and mentoring as part of the <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/70-20-10-rule/">70-20-10 model of leadership development</a>.</p>
<p>The developmental experiences must be designed around leaders’ actual complex challenges, so that they&#8217;re equipped with the mindset, skillset, and toolset to handle these and further challenges.</p>
<h3>2. Developing Leadership Across Divides.</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve researched and developed tools and processes that enable leaders to collaborate effectively across various forms of divides found within and external to their organizations. This enables leaders to <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/make-leadership-happen/">create shared direction, alignment, and commitment</a> so that they collaboratively develop innovative solutions to their RUPT<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> challenges through a process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating safety within their own groups.</li>
<li>Genuinely respecting differences with others.</li>
<li>Developing personal trust with others with whom they need to collaborate.</li>
<li>Building community, and true lasting interdependence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Leveraging Polarities Inherent in Complex Challenges.</h3>
<p>When leaders are confronted with complex challenges amidst RUPT,<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> they tend to tap their well-developed problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Such an approach can add even more complexity. Leaders need to take their thinking to a new level by recognizing seemingly unresolvable challenges <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/are-you-facing-a-problem-or-a-polarity/">not as problems to be solved, but as polarities to be leveraged</a> — shifting their mindset, thinking, and decision-making from <em>either/or</em> to <em>both/and</em>.</p>
<p>When faced with the complex challenges riddled with competing priorities, a problem-solving approach applied independent of polarity thinking can lead to the <em>worst</em> of both worlds: a move towards the greatest fear associated with each dimension of the challenge, rather than the desired and greatest purpose of thinking and acting in terms of <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/manage-paradox-for-better-performance/">managing the paradox</a>.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways that organizations can approach navigating disRUPTion and turbulence in a VUCA world.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not uncommon to occasionally feel disengaged at work – we know from Gallup that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-engagement-rise.aspx?utm_source=link_wwwv9&amp;utm_campaign=item_245786&amp;utm_medium=copy">a majority of U.S. workers are not engaged</a> at work. For millennials in particular, the numbers are troubling; 70% of millennials are either not engaged or are actively <em>dis</em>engaged.</p>
<p>What’s a major reason why employee engagement is so low? Because <strong>new leaders on the front lines are not equipped to lead</strong>. <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/your-frontline-managers-need-these-6-skills/">New leaders on the front lines lead the biggest population of workers in organizations</a>, yet many workers feel unhappy, uninspired, and lack empowerment. Data supports this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 60% of employees report a loss of engagement, productivity, and turnover with poor frontline leadership, and</li>
<li>25% of organizations experience profit loss due to ineffective frontline leaders.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>So, what can leaders do to help employees become more engaged at work?</p>
<h2>4 Areas of Employee Engagement</h2>
<p>We recommend a simple and intuitive framework. We believe these are the 4 factors that drive employee engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manager engagement,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Job engagement,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Team engagement, and</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organizational engagement.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on these 4 key areas, leaders have the power to increase the engagement of the people they lead and serve in a more targeted way.</p>

<h2>How Frontline Leaders Can Improve Employee Engagement</h2>
<p>Here are steps that frontline leaders (and really, leaders at all levels of an organization) can take to increase employee engagement in these 4 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manager Engagement:</strong> Engaged employees feel energized and connected to their boss. To increase manager engagement, frontline leaders can provide routine coaching, development, and feedback. Improving manager engagement builds trust and loyalty to one&#8217;s boss. <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/build-trust-in-the-workplace/">Build trust on your team by delegating</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Job Engagement:</strong> Employees are more engaged when they are actively involved and dedicated to their job. Frontline leaders can increase job engagement by bringing in internal or external stakeholders who have directly benefited from the work their employees have done, and by not micromanaging. Increased job engagement is associated with better work performance. <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/yes-you-can-increase-accountability/">Work on increasing accountability</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Team Engagement: </strong>Employees are more engaged when they are motivated and excited by their coworkers. Frontline leaders can increase team engagement by providing direction, alignment, and commitment (DAC). Increasing team engagement enhances team effectiveness. Here&#8217;s how to <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/make-leadership-happen/">make good leadership happen with DAC</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Organizational Engagement:</strong> Engaged employees are devoted to their organization and feel passionately about its mission. Frontline leaders can increase organizational engagement by advocating for training and development opportunities for their direct reports. Increased organizational engagement is associated with lower employee turnover and better customer satisfaction. <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/talent-development-smart-managers-follow-this-checklist/">This checklist gives managers 4 ways to develop their people</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Process for Building Engagement</h2>
<p>Organizations are more likely to invest in improvement efforts that have a measurable business impact. By better understanding employee engagement across these 4 key areas, leaders can more quickly and efficiently target interventions to increase low-scoring engagement areas.</p>
<p>For example, if employee engagement data shows workers have high engagement with their jobs, organization, and teams, but less so with their managers, interventions should be directed specifically toward increasing manager engagement. Such an intervention would have a greater return on investment and could include teaching leaders how to coach, develop, and provide feedback to others.</p>
<p>At CCL, with <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/can-people-analytics-revolutionize-change/">this data-driven framework as a foundation</a>, we’ve developed a process that enables companies to identify what changes their leaders can make to improve employee engagement — and reap the benefits that come with it.</p>
<p>We’re not suggesting that improving employee engagement is simple or even easy, but it is possible. And it can transform your organization’s ability to get results. Our process provides a systematic, data-driven, measurable process to give your employee engagement a sustainable shot in the arm.</p>
<p>Managers can become one of the organization’s greatest assets if they are taught to understand and manage employee engagement. It&#8217;s time to take a new, directed approach to measuring and managing employee engagement, especially with new and frontline leaders who struggle the most to solve the engagement conundrum.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Promote Relaxation With Intentional Breathing</h2>
<p>At some point in your life, you’ve likely experienced an upsetting situation that provoked anxiety. Maybe you received an email from your boss saying, “We need to talk.” You quickly began to dread the meeting. Thoughts of what might be wrong, or how you might explain yourself, flooded your mind.</p>
<p>When it was finally time to meet, your body’s anxiety reaction was in full swing. Perhaps first you noticed a drop in your stomach. Then once you sat down at your boss’ desk, your heart started beating more quickly and your hands began to sweat.</p>
<p>As these symptoms continued, you noticed your breathing becoming more rapid and shallow. Your mind raced through possible ways to calm yourself, and you remembered the well-intentioned saying, “Take a deep breath!”</p>
<p>In line with this advice, you began to inhale deeply…</p>
<p>But, wait! How helpful is this advice? Most people have been told at some point that<strong> taking deep breaths can have a calming effect, but does it really help to take a deep breath? The short answer is, “No.”</strong> To understand why taking a deep breath might actually be counterproductive, we must first understand the fundamentals of the human breathing process.</p>
<h2>The Physics of Breathing</h2>
<p>Breathing is automatic — that is, most of the time we breathe without being fully aware of it. Breathing is controlled by our body’s autonomic nervous system. This system is made up of 2 divisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which stimulates the body’s fight-or-flight response.</li>
<li>The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which relaxes the body after stimulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 2 systems  parallel the breathing process. When we inhale, our diaphragm moves down and the volume in our thoracic cavity increases as our lungs fill with air. As they fill, they also begin to compress the walls of the heart, which in turn restricts blood flow going into and out of the heart. To compensate for this restriction, our heart rate increases, stimulating our fight-or-flight response. When we exhale, our diaphragm moves up and the volume in our thoracic cavity decreases as our lungs empty the air inside them, which relaxes our bodies.</p>
<p><strong>In short: It is actually our exhale, not our inhale, which helps our body relax.</strong></p>
<h2>Overbreathing</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve described the breathing process, let’s take a look at the recommendation to “take a deep breath.”  If you do this rapidly, it can lead to overbreathing, which can be broadly defined as a breathing pattern that results in breathing out too much carbon dioxide, which, in turn, results in less blood flowing to your brain (i.e. hyperventilating). Typically, we begin to overbreathe when we’re in a panicked or stressed state.</p>
<p>People who tell you to “take a deep breath” probably think they are preventing overbreathing by keeping you from hyperventilating. The thing is, taking in a lot of air and holding it in is <em>still</em> overbreathing. You’re still activating your sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<h2>The Helpful Way to Breathe</h2>
<p>So, what should you do? Although it’s perfectly natural to respond to anxiety and panic with overbreathing, the good news is that we also have the ability to affect our breathing rate. We can change our breathing. This means we can train ourselves to respond to overbreathing with an intentional breathing pattern designed to promote relaxation.</p>
<p>As you sit at your boss’ desk trying to manage your anxiety symptoms, rather than taking a deep breath, focus on extending the exhale.</p>
<p>Some researchers recommend a specific ratio of inhalation to exhalation that can be practiced in the moment when wanting to achieve a more relaxed breathing state. For example, Inna Kahzan, a clinical instructor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, recommends a 4:6 ratio — <strong>40% of the breath cycle spent on inhalation and 60% of the breath cycle spent on exhalation</strong>. With this practice, she recommends “low and slow” diaphragmatic breathing, where you “<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119993717.html">pay attention to the location of the breath</a>, smooth transition from exhalation to inhalation, long and complete exhalation, without focusing on the depth of the inhalation.”</p>
<p>Though the exact breath count that is most helpful for you may vary based on your natural breathing rate (some people tend to breath at a higher/lower rate than others), a rough estimate of what this ratio would look like is to inhale for a count of 1…2…3…4 and then exhale for a count of 1…2…3…4…5…6, where each count lasts one second.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that the focus on extended exhalation as a way to relax your breathing is not a new concept. In fact, many yoga traditions have extended exhalation as a core part of their practice. For example, some researchers have tested the effects of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1971670">pranayama yoga breathing</a>, where the inhalation to exhalation ratio is 1:2, in patients with asthma.</p>
<h2>Breathing Takes Practice</h2>
<p>Take a minute to guide yourself, “Breath in — 1…2…3…4, and breathe out — 1…2…3…4…5…6.” Focus on normal inhalations, neither too short nor too long, and then extend the exhalation. You will begin to notice yourself calming down, which in turn will better enable you to focus on your upcoming challenges. Yet like most things, using breathing to regulate your nervous system takes practice, so it’s important to make extended exhalations a part of your daily routine.</p>
<p>Regardless of your emotional state, take time to practice extended exhalations for 2-5 minutes (or until you notice your breathing rate relax) every day. As with any habit, daily practice will strengthen your ability to engage in extended exhalation when in a state of high anxiety, panic, or stress. Finally, encourage your friends and family to adopt a similar breathing practice when in a state of anxiety.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rather than, “Take a deep breath,” adopt the motto, “Extend your exhale!”</em></strong></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Corporate culture is the self-reinforcing web of beliefs, practices, patterns, and behaviors that become “the way things are done around here.” Leaders’ own conscious and unconscious beliefs drive behaviors, and repeated behaviors become cultural norms.</p>
<p>That’s why changing a long-established organizational culture is so tough. But when the business landscape radically changes, culture must change, too.</p>
<p>In an effort to better understand when and how corporate cultures change, CCL and corporate leaders surveyed a group of global VPs and directors in HR, Learning &amp; Development, Leadership, and Talent Management.</p>
<p>The results were telling. As organizations adapt in the face of change, employees need strong leaders who can clearly communicate the new direction, align the company’s resources, and get commitment from everyone involved.</p>
<p>Why do companies change their culture? According to the survey results, the 3 biggest drivers of cultural transformation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal redefinition of the company’s business model, goals, or performance levels;</li>
<li>Maintaining a market position under intense pressure; and</li>
<li>Technology trends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost half of respondents point to their CEO’s new business model as a cultural transformation driver. “When we work with C-suite executives and with senior teams in our organizational practice, we often hear concerns about the disconnections between the current organizational culture and the needed culture to implement the future-proof strategy,” <u><a href="https://www.ccl.org/people/david-altman/">our COO David Altman</a></u> says.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Owners&#8221; Versus &#8220;Renters&#8221;</h2>
<p>As organizations seek to adapt to changing times, senior executives realize they can’t rely on change through simple restructuring and re-engineering. Instead, they need strong corporate cultures that support efficiency, innovation, and agility to navigate the turbulent business landscape.</p>
<p>And for those corporate cultures to take effect, they need buy-in from employees willing to assume ownership.</p>
<p>“While developing a future-proof strategy is challenging, it’s even more challenging to build an organization-wide leadership culture that can quickly and effectively implement and adapt the strategy in a rapidly changing business climate,” Altman says.</p>
<p>‘’You potentially have an organization filled with ‘renters’ who don’t see themselves as responsible for the success of the organization, as opposed to ‘owners.’<strong> If you have people throughout the organization with an ownership mentality, the odds of success go up dramatically.” </strong></p>
<p>“Owners” take responsibility for their team and organization, signaling to colleagues and stakeholders their commitment. And all it takes to be an owner is to act like one.</p>
<h2>Leading Through Change Fatigue</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges blocking culture change is often a general feeling of resistance to organizational change — a.k.a. “<a href="https://www.ccl.org/blog/change-fatigue-continual-evolution/">change fatigue</a>.” Similarly, it is not unusual to see similar resistance from managers, the senior team, and staff, especially when the business climate is changing rapidly and organizations are launching many change efforts in response, because <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/how-change-can-replenish-or-drain-your-reserves/">change has a cumulative effect and can drain your reserves</a>.</p>
<p>Leaders often have their heads down and worry about the changes that are constantly buffeting their organization, but they aren’t conveying it to their employees in a way that would allow them to be more resilient.</p>
<p>The importance and value of leadership training and coaching came out clearly in the survey results. A resounding 81% rated “leadership coaching and mentoring” as highly-to-somewhat effective in implementing cultural transformation; 84% also rated “leadership and staff training” as highly to-somewhat-effective. <strong>The message is clear: Leadership matters most.</strong></p>
<p>Our perspective is that <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/make-leadership-happen/">leadership takes direction, alignment, and commitment (DAC)</a>.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re in a command-and-control, hierarchical organization or one that is decentralized, if you see evidence of direction, alignment, and commitment, then leadership is happening,” Altman explains. “When you don’t have high levels of either of those 3 things, then there’s a leadership gap, and many organizations struggle with that. An organization might have direction and commitment — everyone knows where they are going and are pulling together to achieve it — but the processes and the systems and the way the organization is set up is chaotic.”</p>
<p>According to Altman, in that instance, it doesn’t matter how clear the direction and commitment are if a lack of alignment is preventing you from getting there.</p>
<h2>To Change Corporate Culture, Start With Baby Steps</h2>
<p>Cultural transformation is most easily achieved through small, incremental behavioral changes. That’s because bold, audacious goals are often perceived as daunting and unachievable. They can also be viewed as overly simplistic and too broad to guide day-to-day goal achievement behaviors.</p>
<p>For most organizations, this type of gradual change is the norm. When respondents were asked to best describe their cultural transformation initiatives, 57% reported initiatives strengthening, deepening, or refining the organization’s existing culture.</p>
<p>“When leaders focus only on large-scale, transformational change, they run the risk of paralyzing people from taking any action,” says Altman. “Instead, if they create opportunities for small wins, in which tangible progress is made day-by-day and month-by-month, the accumulation of such progress ends up being large-scale change.”</p>
<p>Altman uses a military strategy analogy to explain: “Avoid always displaying a frontal assault on transformational change. Consider flanking maneuvers as a way around the obstacles of pushing through transformational change in one fell swoop.”</p>
<p>Breaking down bold goals into component parts in which the sum of the parts is greater than the whole can be a more sustainable way to consistently address transformational changes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that there’s a quick fix for culture can cause lots of problems. As Jay W. Lorsch and Emily McTague put it in their <a href="ttps://hbr.org/2016/04/culture-is-not-the-culprit"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> article</a>, “Culture isn’t something you ‘fix.’ &#8230; Cultural change is what you get after you’ve put new processes or structures in place to tackle tough business challenges. &#8230; Culture isn’t a final destination. It morphs right along with the company’s competitive environment and objectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Employees are constantly told they need to change processes and practices, only for the leadership team to keep on doing what they always do, and managers maintaining the same old routines. Despite an initial surge of enthusiasm, nothing ever changes. The irony is that “change fatigue” can set in, despite “the way we do things around here” remaining very much the same.</p>
<p>Our latest survey with corporate leaders found that <strong>change fatigue is one of the top 2 challenges </strong>faced when building organizational cultures. Other surveys state that change initiatives flounder because companies lack the skills to sustain change over time. When the reasons and need for change are poorly communicated, everyone feels frustrated and deflated.</p>
<h2>Becoming Resilient in the Face of Change</h2>
<p>David Altman, our COO, argues for giving leaders and employees a short, sharp shock: In effect, “If you think change is constant now, then you ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p>
<p>“What leaders must do is to help employees and managers to recalibrate their expectations,” Altman argues. “This is the world we live in now — change is a constant. There is no ‘getting back to normal.’ The message from leaders needs to be: ‘Let’s get ourselves in shape as individuals and as an organizational culture to embrace the opportunities and to manage the challenges of constant change in the dynamic world that we live in. Let’s equip ourselves together to become more resilient to accommodate that.’”</p>
<h2>4 Steps to Overcoming Change Fatigue</h2>
<p>According to Altman, leaders can help employees — and themselves — cope with change fatigue by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Help the organization continually prioritize change efforts, and focus on the change initiatives that are the highest priority.</p>
<p>2. Recognize and talk about how change is both the beginning of something new and an ending of something that previously was embraced as a best practice.</p>
<p>3. Teach employees evidence-based techniques for managing stress, building resilience, and deploying copying skills in the face of high demands.</p>
<p>4. Focus attention on building a culture of high psychological safety in which people can take interpersonal risks by speaking their truths.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last step will help leaders understand the challenges and opportunities that exist throughout the organization, which in turn will help leaders be more effective in leading their teams through change,&#8221; Altman says.</p>
<h2>Viewing Change as Continual Evolution</h2>
<p>As an example, Altman relates the experience of a large company in the energy sector attempting to reinvent itself in the face of volatile market conditions. “This is an organization that realizes, given the VUCA [Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous] world of energy — whether it is oil and gas prices, competition, government policies and so on — that what worked in the past doesn’t work anymore, which was just generating energy and selling it at a good price. It’s also not just about hiring more good engineers.”</p>
<p>Engineers are trained to identify problems and come up with a solution; they are steeped in LEAN and Six Sigma. &#8220;But they are not set up to take risks, to be innovative, and try new things out,” Altman adds.</p>
<p>Across all industries, many traditional, hierarchical global companies struggle to adapt with sufficient speed and, as a result, must change their mindsets about what is needed to survive and thrive in the new world order.</p>
<p>Legacy companies with ingrained cultures have to understand that<strong> “there is no end point — this is continual evolution,” </strong>Altman says. The ability to be innovative and flexible is directly linked to the ability to constantly change and seek new opportunities.</p>
<p>“Most successful change initiatives start with baby steps, even transformational change,” he adds. “If you want to lose weight, you don’t starve yourself for a week — that isn’t sustainable. Instead, let’s get ourselves in shape as individuals and as organizations to embrace the opportunities and to manage the challenges of constant change in the dynamic world that we live in.”</p>
<p>It may be a tough message. But it need not be a harsh reality. Forget “change fatigue,” Altman says; instead, think of “change energy.” Dynamic, innovative, changing, and constantly learning: This is the new reality. And with the right leadership, it&#8217;s an exciting and galvanizing message for employees.<a href="#_ftnref" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Avoid These 3 Common Mistakes When Goal-Setting</h2>
<p>Setting personal goals can help you improve and change, and achieve satisfaction, and feel like you are moving through your life and your career with direction. Yet too often, people set goals based on their thinking alone. You are much more likely to achieve your goals if they align with your values.</p>
<p>Setting goals isn&#8217;t easy. It takes time and commitment. Avoid these 3 common goal-setting mistakes to keep your career, and your life, on track:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your goal isn&#8217;t valued enough.</strong> If you haven’t committed your mind <em>and </em>heart to the goal, you are more likely to fail. Bring your heart into the goal-setting process and examine how your goals align with your values — the underlying life principles that you believe are important. Learn more about how to set goals that align with your values below.</li>
<li><strong>Your goal isn&#8217;t specific enough. </strong>Your goal may be too broad and overwhelming. Recast your aspirations into the form of a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timed). Learn more about SMART goals below. After drafting your SMART goals, you can plan how you can break your larger goals into smaller, specific steps that will move you in the right direction.</li>
<li><strong>Your goal isn&#8217;t supported enough.</strong> You are more likely to succeed at your goals if you have someone serving as your coach, cheerleader, or mentor. Ask friends, family, and co-workers for their support and to hold you accountable as you work toward your goals. Revisit your goals at regular intervals to make sure you’re on track and to re-energize your efforts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Set Goals That You&#8217;ll Achieve</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to avoid these common goal-busters and how to set goals that align with your values:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-40052" src="https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-1024x536.jpg" alt="how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership" width="750" height="393" srcset="https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-330x173.jpg 330w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership.jpg 1200w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-736x385.jpg 736w, https://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/how-to-set-goals-Infographic-center-for-creative-leadership-414x217.jpg 414w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Reflect and take stock of exactly what your values are.</strong> There&#8217;s little motivation for success if your goals don’t connect to your values. Of course, to make this work you need to know exactly what your values are. We recommend looking at 5 areas of your life — career, self, family, community, and spirit — and consider how you are living out your values in each of those areas. Gaining this perspective will give you some ideas about what you might like to change or improve.</p>
<p>To do this, consider: <em>How do you spend your time and energy? What are you passionate about? What do you need to do more of? What should you cut back on? What is missing?</em></p>
<p>Take time to process your thoughts and feelings and consider feedback you&#8217;ve been given. List 5 things you would like to change or do differently. Write them down as possible goals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Focus.</strong> Select just <em>one</em> goal out of the 5 to focus on first, and add enough detail to turn it into a SMART goal:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Specific:</strong> </em>Write down your goal with as much detail as possible.</li>
<li><em><strong>Measurable:</strong></em> Identify quantitative targets for tracking your progress and results.</li>
<li><em><strong>Attainable:</strong> </em>Make certain that it is possible to achieve the desired result.</li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic:</strong></em> Acknowledge the practical requirements necessary to accomplish the goal.</li>
<li><em><strong>Timed:</strong> </em>Build in specific deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Plan.</strong> Break down your SMART goal into small, specific steps that will move you in the right direction. Begin by listing at least one action to take in the next week. Schedule a time to do it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Enlist support.</strong> Think about family, friends, or co-workers whom you can inform of your new goal and ask for support. They can help hold you accountable for making progress. Carefully select whom you tell and when you tell them, so as not to undermine your motivation or progress.</p>
<p><strong>5. Revisit.</strong> Each week, assess how you are doing against your goal. Keep a focus on your values. Decide what actions you will take that week toward achieving your goal. Set new milestones as needed.</p>
<p>Yes, this process takes time. Choosing and planning your goals and making sure your goals align with your values is hard work.  The rewards, however, are priceless.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to Increase Your Executive Presence</h2>
<p>I recently spoke with the CEO of a medium-sized manufacturing company about his new CFO who was poised to attend our flagship program for senior executives, Leadership at the Peak. He’d recently promoted her and was very comfortable with that decision until a week later.</p>
<p>He told me she was smart, very hardworking, and had been with the company in various accounting roles for the past 4 years, most recently as comptroller. She was respected by colleagues and employees, and over time had become the right-hand assistant to the CFO. So when the CFO announced his retirement, she seemed like a natural candidate. Sure enough, after a brief search she was promoted to the position.</p>
<p>The following week the company hosted a small celebration consisting of the accounting office, various department heads, and other members of the senior leadership team.</p>
<p>The CEO arrived early and mingled with the gathering — soon the newly appointed CFO entered. What startled the CEO was the greeting she received. No one turned a head. There was no recognition or applause, and the way she entered clearly suggested she didn’t expect any such attention. Soon she was a part of the crowd, and while everyone was congratulatory, the excitement she and her promotion generated was decidedly mute.</p>
<p>“I saw then what I knew but had failed to recognize before,” the CEO told me. “She had all the skills for the job but one; she lacked an executive presence, a certain energy, and gravitas. She neither commanded nor received attention.”</p>
<p>“I need her to have a bigger presence,” he told me, “because her new role not only includes presenting the numbers, but instilling investor confidence in those numbers. That executive presence is what I’ll need when, as a team, she and I meet with major stakeholders and analysts. I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>Sometimes called charisma, the CEO was referring to that special quality some people possess or learn that allows them to authentically show up and command respect as leaders. The Greek origins of the word “charisma” itself convey a certain mystique, and suggest that it was seen as a divine gift related to qualities of grace and desire.</p>
<p>And indeed, some people do seem to innately possess an abundance of charisma, which has been shown in a variety of C-suite studies to be a significant factor in executive success.</p>
<p>But what if, like this CFO, an executive has proven functional skills but is lacking in what the CEO called executive presence? What can be done? Can executive presence be taught?</p>
<p>Despite a growing body of research into what comprises executive presence and how it’s developed, particularly for women and non-native English speaking professionals, it remains an inexact science with decidedly mixed advice.</p>
<p>According to a study done by the Center for Talent Innovation in 2013, women in particular feel an intrinsic tension between being authentic and conforming to corporate cultural norms. Women in the study said that feedback about executive presence is often contradictory and difficult to act on.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest learning of the past few years is that charisma is not only a gift bestowed on a few — <strong>it’s a highly prized skill that can be acquired.</strong></p>
<p>Leaders can gain these skills with experience and by modeling the behavior of others around them who exhibit the qualities needed to be successful. Or they can pursue an accelerated training approach, one requiring considerable feedback and clear development goals. By coming to <a href="https://www.ccl.org/open-enrollment-programs/leadership-at-the-peak/"><strong>Leadership at the Peak</strong></a>, this CFO had — with some encouragement and initial trepidation — chosen the latter approach.</p>
<p>The first day of her training at CCL included a simulated live TV interview. As her cohort came into our TV studio area, I recognized her immediately. Her thin smile and wide eyes suggested nervousness as she sat in suspense. One by one her group came up to be interviewed and filmed for later review. When it was her turn, I could see that watching previous participants had done little to calm her fluttering nerves. We chatted briefly while the floor director placed a microphone on her lapel and then after a short countdown and introduction, we were live.</p>
<p>The questions she got weren’t easy. With the help of her CEO and others who worked with her I was able to identify the challenges she and the company were facing. More importantly, these were issues she would likely be talking about again in other venues — before her team, her board, or with major stakeholders.</p>
<p>While the staging was designed to make this feel very real, it was essentially a pressurized practice opportunity allowing her to see how she came across as a leader. The only real audience was the TV crew and her cohort. The only real judgment was that which she bore. At the end of the week she would go home with the only copy of her time under the hot studio lights.</p>
<p>Our dictum is “challenge and support,” and this was clearly a challenge for her. After the interview, the applause, and high-fives from her colleagues, this CFO was smiling, relieved to be finished. Yet this was just the first and perhaps easiest part to the exercise. We would be getting together again later that day to deconstruct the interview along with her coach and others I’d interviewed.</p>
<p>That afternoon in our debrief room, we rolled her interview and stopped after the first question. I noticed she had pushed her chair back from the table. Arms crossed, a look almost of pain etched her forehead. How did she feel about her response, I ventured? She was obviously not happy with her performance so I added, “So let’s start with what you liked about it. What did you do well?”</p>
<p>Looking puzzled she laughed and said, “I’m so used to being critical, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>A colleague offered, “She used your name, Michael, and she smiled.” Another said, “Her answer was very clear and she looks like an executive.” Her coach added, “This is a strong start. I’m looking forward to hearing more.”</p>
<p>After another question, I paused again and asked her for her take. She was smiling, and with a sigh said, “It was actually better than I thought. I was so nervous I wasn’t sure if what I was saying made any sense at all.”</p>
<p>As we watched the rest of the interview, patterns emerged. Overall, she did a credible job, dutifully answering the questions, often with an auditor’s earnestness. The topics tempted her into giving tactical responses, and as she provided a logical litany of reasons for company actions, her demeanor grew ever more serious. There was nothing wrong with what she said or how she said it, but her new role demanded more than a detailed rationale; it required a certain charisma, an executive presence that was still embryonic.</p>
<p>John Antonakis — at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland — conducted one of the more intriguing studies of charisma. His team wanted to see if charisma could be taught. First, they deconstructed the constituent elements, which their research suggested were the foundations of charisma. Then, through a number of carefully designed interventions, they were able to successfully increase the perception of charisma in a group of mid-level managers.</p>
<p>Antonakis’ study demonstrated that with the right approach,<strong> charisma can indeed be learned.</strong> One of the key findings is that charisma is rooted in a leader’s ability to inspire and influence through emotional and often non-verbal communication.</p>
<p>This CFO was expected to have command of the facts in her new role. That was a given. But she also needed to be able to express those facts within a strategic framework that tapped into emotional registers. She needed to convey the facts in a way that was engaging and made us not only understand, but care.</p>
<p>Watching the video, she saw that her responses were largely cerebral, her emotional affect mostly flat. She learned that by tapping into her genuine passion for the business’ purpose and including relevant stories and examples, she was able to relax and make her responses much more compelling. By the end of the debrief, she began to understand that her new role was more than being a leader of metrics; she could become a strategic partner in communicating the exciting vision of the company from her unique vantage.</p>
<p>As part of the program, I provided her with some additional tools to help expedite this process. When we wrapped up, she told us she was eager to begin working with her coach on implementing this expanded perspective in her communications.</p>
<p>Creating or improving charisma isn’t easy, but it can be done. Executive presence <em>can </em>be taught. I’ve seen it happen time and again, where there is a proven process that provides ample constructive feedback along with ongoing coaching and support.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leaders shape our nation, communities, and organizations.</p>
<p>We need good leaders to help guide us and make the essential large-scale decisions that keep the world moving.</p>
<p>Our society is usually quick to identify a bad leader, but how to identify a good one? What would most people say makes a good leader?</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of a Good Leader</h2>
<p>Based on our research, we&#8217;ve found that great leaders consistently possess these 10 core leadership traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honesty</li>
<li>Ability to delegate</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Sense of humor</li>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Commitment</li>
<li>Positive attitude</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Ability to inspire</li>
<li>Intuition</li>
</ul>
<p>While many powerful and successful leaders haven&#8217;t exhibited all of these character traits, and the definition of a good leader can be quite ambiguous, most good leaders do leverage at least some of these characteristics.</p>

<hr />
<p>Take someone you view as a great leader. How many of these characteristics do they express?</p>
<p>If the characteristics of a good leader above don&#8217;t describe you, don&#8217;t panic — there are ways for you to improve upon your leadership capabilities. We believe <a href="https://www.ccl.org/blog/leaders-born-made-part-ii/">that leaders are not born, but made</a>, and are molded through experience, continued study, and adaptation.</p>
<p>Consider too, whether you have <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/fundamental-4-core-leadership-skills-for-every-career-stage/">the core leadership skills you need in every role</a>, since everyone  – from individual contributors and first-time managers to the most seasoned senior executives – needs these same 4 leadership competencies to be truly effective.</p>
<p>Like any craft, leadership requires that you learn from your mistakes and continually work at strengthening your weaknesses. Seek out a mentor that you admire. Jot down the characteristics that you feel makes them a great leader. Then ask yourself, <em>How do I compare?</em></p>
<p>Chances are, they weren’t always a great leader, so determine what they did along the way to become the leader they are today. And keep working on developing the 10 characteristics of a good leader.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I ask clients what kind of return they’re looking for from a leadership development initiative, it’s usually in terms of how the initiative can have a visible, measurable impact on the organization.</p>
<p>Many factors drive the success of a leadership development initiative. We’ve identified 7 key factors that can make or break its impact:</p>
<h2>Tips for a More Successful Organizational Leadership Development Initiative</h2>
<p><strong>1. Involve your business unit managers. </strong>It’s all about alignment. As heads of the business units and the direct managers of the program participants, the business unit leaders directly impact the mindset participants will have in the program, as well as the environment they will return to when the program is over. If participants return to their jobs and hear “I don’t care what they told you in the classroom, here’s the reality around here,” then little behavior change is likely to happen.</p>
<p><strong>2. Clarify why participants are in the program.</strong> I recently conducted a leadership development program for middle managers and asked the participants why they were there. One third of the class answered with some version of “I was told to be here by HR/the organization.” When you hear that as a facilitator, you know you have your work cut out for you.</p>
<p>If participants don’t have a purpose in coming to the program, they will likely spend those days with their body in the classroom and their minds back at the office.</p>
<p>We encourage participants to have a conversation with their direct manager prior to attending our programs to agree on what the participant should focus on during the program, what outcomes the manager expects, and the support the manager will give to the participant following the program.</p>
<p><strong>3. Partner with your leadership development provider.</strong> Your leadership development provider should take the time to know the environment, culture, and leadership strategy of your organization. This helps make the classroom experience more impactful for the participants. I once ran a program that received a low end-of-program evaluation score. I spoke with the client and they shared that a large re-organization had been announced within the company and everyone was worried about losing their jobs. Had we known of this, we might have been able to help participants work through the change during the workshop.</p>
<p>As a client, you should have confidence that your leadership development provider is an expert in their field. An effective partnership is one in which your provider/partner knows what is happening in your organization, and they are able to take that information and tailor the program according to your leaders’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Prioritize your leadership development efforts.</strong> There are many reasons an organization invests in leadership development. Some common themes include: equipping new/emerging leaders so they start off on the right foot, preparing high-potential leaders for jobs at the next level, or addressing specific organizational challenges such as rapid expansion or a cultural transition. Resources are often tight and most leadership development functions cannot do everything on their wish list. It will be important to partner with business unit leaders to determine what is most critical and which initiatives they can support.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don’t focus only on senior level leaders. </strong>While resources may require you to prioritize your plans, that doesn’t mean that doesn’t mean you can afford to neglect the development needs of leaders at other levels. One of the challenges of leading an internal leadership development function is providing cost-effective development for all leaders. This may take some creativity and innovation on your part. Can senior leaders take on the role of trainer in programs? How can you use e-learning and technology to stretch and enhance your development efforts? Can you license instructional materials and deliver programs with internal trainers? Asking yourself these questions may help you leverage the resources you already have.</p>
<p><strong>6. Think beyond classroom learning.</strong> Leadership development initiatives need to go far beyond the several days of the program itself. Initiatives are now often a 6- to 12-month journey rather than a one-off event. Be sure to plan for the preparation, engagement, and application stages of the initiative.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation stage: </strong>This involves everything that a participant will go through before the program begins, including pre-reading materials, pre-assessments and even conversations with managers to determine the area of focus.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement stage: </strong>This includes what happens during the training program itself. How can you create space for the participant to focus on their learning and disengage from their “day job?”</li>
<li><strong>Application stage: </strong> How can you ensure that what is taught lasts beyond the program? This includes following up with participants&#8217; managers, creating accountability partners, facilitating application activities, and checking in on goals that were set during the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the impact of your leadership development initiative should extend and continue long after a program has concluded. Remember that what happens after the program is just as important as what happens during the program.</p>
<p><strong>7. Share the impact of your leadership development efforts in terms your business leaders understand</strong>. We often talk about influence in terms of the head, the heart, and the hands. You need to speak to your stakeholders in terms that are important to them. If they speak the language of numbers, be sure to talk about the financial investment, and gather and share evaluation data at the end of the program and in the months following it. This will help your stakeholders understand the effectiveness of the program, the learning that occurred, and how the learning was applied back on the job.</p>
<p>If your leaders tend to lead more from the heart, be sure to capture real stories of how participants have impacted employees based on what they learned in the program. Are they communicating with their peers and employees better? Did a leader who looked like they were “derailing” turn things around? Have employee engagement scores improved?</p>
<p>Some senior leader stakeholders are best influenced by being actively involved in things. How can you get them involved and more committed to your initiatives? Can they be the one to invite people to the program? Will they be on a panel to evaluate action-learning projects? Will they financially sponsor excursions for participants to visit different plants/offices/facilities? Will they share their own leadership journeys in the class?</p>
<p><strong>In the world of leadership development, if you can demonstrate an impact, you can influence the organization in very important ways.</strong> Begin with the end in mind and be clear about what it is that you’re trying to accomplish with your leadership development efforts. And focus particularly on these 7 factors, which increase the odds of success in organizational leadership development.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s obvious that leaders in different levels of the organization have to lead differently — think about how different the leadership challenges are for a line supervisor than the CEO.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that leaders who are looking to drive innovation have different challenges depending on their position. There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>Given that schedules are too full already, it&#8217;s useful to know what to do, and this helps shape what <em>not</em> to do, as well.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of the roles and responsibilities by leader level specific to innovation:</p>
<h2>Leading Self — Creating</h2>
<p>At the level where you don&#8217;t have direct reports — but serve as a role model or perhaps a leader of project teams — the responsibilities around innovation fall mainly into the realm of knowing <em>how</em> to generate creative solutions and having a keen interest in participating on a team made up of diverse participants.</p>
<p>Core to this is the ability to find sources of inspiration for new approaches, whether that means looking at other industries, engaging customers and stakeholders, or exploring patent databases for similar challenges that have been solved by others.</p>
<h2>Leading Others – Facilitating</h2>
<p>Team leaders or line supervisors need to possess additional skills. They must know how to lead the group process, which requires special facilitation skills on top of those necessary for being an effective team leader or project manager.</p>
<p>And for innovation to take root and spread through the organization, these leaders or supervisors need the ability to obtain resources from outside their unit.</p>

<h2>Leading Managers — Advocating/Bridging</h2>
<p>When you lead people who are leading others, a key value you bring to the challenge of innovation is supporting and protecting the team from superiors or other parts of the organization.</p>
<p>Great leaders create a protective umbrella over their people to ensure that the discomfort, risk, and potential disruption of the business don&#8217;t cause others to try to shut down these efforts.  These managers also have to build a case for grassroots innovation and bridge groups that are working on similar challenges to ensure constructive cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Leading Functions – Directing/Protecting</h2>
<p>Leaders of a function or significant silo need to provide clear direction for the scope of the innovation efforts and also need to manage conflicting demands for resources.</p>
<p>They must initiate strategic and structural changes to accommodate promising innovations and establish a strategy that bridges the silos.</p>
<p>As if that&#8217;s not enough, they are critical to modeling behavior and driving communication that sets the organizational tone that determines the support of innovation. They&#8217;re also critical in the management of innovation pipeline and balancing the portfolio &#8220;bets&#8221; that help determine the future direction of the organization&#8217;s innovation.</p>
<h2>Leading the Organization – Mandating/Fostering</h2>
<p>Finally, we have the top of the organization. These are the people who have the critical job of setting a strategy to ensure that the organization has clear direction on where it&#8217;s going.</p>
<p>More than that, they are the keystone for fostering a culture of innovation, a big part of which is modeling behaviors to ensure that the walk matches the talk, which sometimes means showing support for different, new, or disruptive ideas.</p>
<p>Like other top leadership responsibilities, it&#8217;s imperative that they communicate the vision over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Perhaps the hardest job is finding ways to hear and see unfiltered concepts, since the further you go up the hierarchy, the less connected to &#8220;what&#8217;s really true&#8221; you become.</p>
